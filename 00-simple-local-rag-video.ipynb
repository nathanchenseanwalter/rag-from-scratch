Clinical dietitians also confer with  doctors and other health-care professionals to coordinate dietary  recommendations with medical needs. Nutrition jobs in the  community often involve working in public health clinics,  cooperative extension offices, and HMOs to prevent disease and  promote the health of the local community. Nutrition jobs in the  nonprofit world involve anti-hunger organizations, public health  organizations, and activist groups.  Nutritionists and dietitians can also find work in the private  sector. Increased public awareness of food, diet, and nutrition has  led to employment opportunities in advertising, marketing, and  food manufacturing. Dietitians working in these areas analyze foods,  prepare marketing materials, or report on issues such as the impact  of vitamins and herbal supplements. Consultant careers can include  working in wellness programs, supermarkets, physicians’ offices,  gyms, and weight-loss clinics. Consultants in private practice  perform nutrition screenings for clients and use their findings to  provide guidance on diet-related issues, such as weight reduction.  Nutrition careers in the corporate world include designing wellness  strategies and nutrition components for companies, working as  representatives for food or supplement companies, designing  marketing and educational campaigns, and becoming lobbyists.  Others in the private sector work in food-service management at  health-care facilities or at company and school cafeterias.  Sustainable agricultural practices are also providing interesting  private sector careers on farms and in food systems. There are  employment opportunities in farm management, marketing and  sales, compliance, finance, and land surveying and appraisal.  Careers in Nutrition  |  1145'},\n",

During exercise, especially when it is performed for  longer than two to three hours, muscle tissue is broken down and  some of the amino acids are catabolized to fuel muscle contraction.  To avert excessive borrowing of amino acids from muscle tissue to  synthesize energy during prolonged exercise, protein needs to be  obtained from the diet. Intense exercise, such as strength training,  stresses muscle tissue so that afterward, the body adapts by  building bigger, stronger, and healthier muscle tissue. The body  requires protein post-exercise to accomplish this. The IOM does  not set different RDAs for protein intakes for athletes, but the AND,  the American College of Sports Medicine, and Dietitians of Canada  have the following position statements4:  Nitrogen balance studies suggest that dietary protein intake  necessary to support nitrogen balance in endurance athletes  ranges from 1.2 to 1.4 grams per kilogram of body weight per  day.  Recommended protein intakes for strength-trained athletes  range from approximately 1.2 to 1.7 grams per kilogram of  weight per day.  An endurance athlete who weighs 170 pounds should take in 93  to 108 grams of protein per day (170 ÷ 2.2 × 1.2 and 170 ÷ 2.2 ×  1.4). On a 3,000-kilocalorie diet, that amount is between 12 and 14  4.\\xa0American College of Sports Medicine, Academy of  Nutrition and Dietetics, and Dietitians of Canada. (2009).

The skeleton is composed of two main  parts, the axial and the appendicular parts. The axial skeleton  consists of the skull, vertebral column, and rib cage, and is  composed of eighty bones. The appendicular skeleton consists of  the shoulder girdle, pelvic girdle, and upper and lower extremities,  and is composed of 126 bones. Bones are also categorized by size  and shape. There are four types of bone: long bones, short bones,  flat bones, and irregular bones. The longest bone in your body is the  femur (thigh bone), which extends from your hip to your knee. It is a  long bone and functions to support your weight as you stand, walk,  or run. Your wrist is composed of eight irregular-shaped bones,  which allow for the intricate movements of your hands. Your twelve  ribs on each side of your body are curved flat bones that protect  your heart and lungs. Thus, the bones’ different sizes and shapes  allow for their different functions.  Bones are composed of approximately 65 percent inorganic  material known as mineralized matrix. This mineralized matrix  consists of mostly crystallized hydroxyapatite. The bone’s hard  crystal matrix of bone tissue gives it its rigid structure. The other  35 percent of bone is organic material, most of which is the fibrous  protein collagen. The collagen fibers are networked throughout  bone tissue and provide it with flexibility and strength. The bones’  inorganic and organic materials are structured into two different  tissue types. There is spongy bone, also called trabecular or  cancellous bone, and compact bone, also called cortical bone  (Figure 2.26 “The Arrangement of Bone Tissues”). The two tissue  types differ in their microarchitecture and porosity. Trabecular  bone is 50 to 90 percent porous and appears as a lattice-like  structure under the microscope. It is found at the ends of long  bones, in the cores of vertebrae, and in the pelvis. Trabecular bone  tissue makes up about 20 percent of the adult skeleton.

Glucose is then transported to all our cells where it is stored, used to make energy, or used to build macromolecules. Fiber is also a complex carbohydrate, but it cannot be broken down by digestive enzymes in the human intestine. As a result, it passes through the digestive tract undigested unless the bacteria that inhabit the colon or large intestine break it down. One gram of digestible carbohydrates yields four kilocalories of energy for the cells in the body to perform work. In addition to providing energy and serving as building blocks for bigger macromolecules, carbohydrates are essential for proper functioning of the nervous system, heart, and kidneys. As mentioned, glucose can be stored in the body for future use. In humans, the storage molecule of carbohydrates is called glycogen, and in plants, it is known as starch.
