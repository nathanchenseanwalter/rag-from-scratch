When the process of  hydrogenation is not complete, for example, not all carbon double  bonds have been saturated the end result is a partially hydrogenated  oil. The resulting oil is not fully solid. Total hydrogenation makes  the oil very hard and virtually unusable. Some newer products are  now using fully hydrogenated oil combined with nonhydrogenated  vegetable oils to create a usable fat.  Manufacturers favor hydrogenation as a way to prevent oxidation  of oils and ensure longer shelf life. Partially hydrogenated vegetable  oils are used in the fast food and processed food industries because  they impart the desired texture and crispness to baked and fried  foods. Partially hydrogenated vegetable oils are more resistant to  breakdown from extremely hot cooking temperatures. Because  hydrogenated oils have a high smoking point they are very well  suited for frying. In addition, processed vegetable oils are cheaper  than fats obtained from animal sources, making them a popular  choice for the food industry.  Trans fatty acids occur in small amounts in nature, mostly in  dairy products. However, the trans fats that are used by the food  industry are produced from the hydrogenation process. Trans fats  are a result of the partial hydrogenation of unsaturated fatty acids,  which cause them to have a trans configuration, rather than the  naturally occurring cis configuration.  Health Implications of Trans Fats  No trans fats! Zero trans fats! We see these advertisements on a  regular basis. So widespread is the concern over the issue that  restaurants, food manufacturers, and even fast-food establishments  proudly tout either the absence or the reduction of these fats within  their products. Amid the growing awareness that trans fats may not  be good for you, let’s get right to the heart of the matter. Why are  trans fats so bad?  Lipids and the Food Industry  |  341'}]"

The circulatory system, respiratory system, integumentary system,  immune system, brain, and other organs require fatty acids for  proper function. The body is capable of synthesizing most of the  fatty acids it needs from food. These fatty acids are known as  nonessential fatty acids. However, there are some fatty acids that  the body cannot synthesize and these are called essential fatty  acids. It is important to note that nonessential fatty acids doesn’t  mean unimportant; the classification is based solely on the ability of  the body to synthesize the fatty acid.  Essential fatty acids must be obtained from food. They fall into  two categories—omega-3 and omega-6. The 3 and 6 refer to the  position of the first carbon double bond and the omega refers to  the methyl end of the chain. Omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids  are precursors to important compounds called eicosanoids.  Eicosanoids are powerful hormones that control many other  hormones and important body functions, such as the central  nervous system and the immune system. Eicosanoids derived from  omega-6 fatty acids are known to increase blood pressure, immune  response, and inflammation. In contrast, eicosanoids derived from  omega-3 fatty acids are known to have heart-healthy effects. Given  the contrasting effects of the omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids, a  proper dietary balance between the two must be achieved to ensure  optimal health benefits.  Essential fatty acids play an important role in the life and death  of cardiac cells, immune system function, and blood pressure  regulation.

Once the blood is oxygenated, it drains from the alveoli by way of multiple pulmonary veins that exit the lungs to carry oxygen to the rest of the body.
